3. Number Guessing Game
Problem:
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. The user must input their guess, and the program should print:

"Too High" if the guess is greater than the number.
"Too Low" if the guess is smaller.
"Correct! You win!" if the guess is right.
Bonus Challenge:
Allow the user to try 3 times before revealing the answer.

4. ATM Withdrawal System
Problem:
Write a program that simulates an ATM. It should:

Ask the user for their PIN (assume the correct PIN is "1234").
If the PIN is correct, ask how much money they want to withdraw.

Otherwise, show "Insufficient funds!".
If they enter the wrong PIN 3 times, lock the account.
